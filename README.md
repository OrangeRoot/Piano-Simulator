# Small Piano Simulator App

## Usage

To play a song, select the song you want to play from the song list and click the play button. The keyboard keys will be highlighted in yellow, and a short sample of the selected song will be played. You can use the app to learn how to play the song, as you can play along with the highlighted keys.
